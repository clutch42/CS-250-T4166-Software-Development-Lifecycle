# CS-250-T4166-Software-Development-Lifecycle

In order to interpret user needs it seemed the easiest way to find out what they want is to simply ask them. In the initial meeting with the client we got the information on what they wanted out of the application, and in the focus group with the application users, they told us what they were interested in seeing on the site. Once we had this information, it was easy to turn it into user stories. If the request was a larger amount of work, we would have to split it into more than one user story. Then once we had the stories, they got added into the sprint and sent to the developers and testers until they passed the definintion of done.
